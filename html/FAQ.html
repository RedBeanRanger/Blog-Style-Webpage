                    <li> What is the purpose of this site?</li>
                        <p class = "meat">This site, "The Creative Cafe on the Web", is meant to be a site where you can find inspiration and just browse around for fun.
                          This site was intended for writers who have a writer's block or anyone who is bored and needs ideas.
                          I have provided writing prompts and photos and various other content on this site for stimulating your imagination.
                          Generally, I will update it once a month.
                          I hope it's of use to you!
                        </p>
                    <li> Can I use content for free from this site?</li>
                        <p class = "meat"> Yes, only as long as it's for personal use and you cite the source properly.
                          You cannot distribute content from this site for your own profit.
                        </p>
                    <li> Is it possible for me to leave comments or give feedback?</li>
                    <p class = "meat"> Unfortunately, this site does not have a comment section yet.
                      Until I create one, you can email me at angelaxz123@icloud.com.
                    </p>
                    <li> What if I have something to add to this site?</li>
                    <p class = "meat">If you have more material that could be inspiration for writers, you are by all means welcome to share it with me!
                       Email me at angelaxz123@icloud.com and I will put it into my site if I think it's appropriate. :)
