          Hi! My name is Angela Zhang, and I am currently 15 years old. I am attending Shanghai Community International School for 10<sup>th</sup> grade.
         <br/><br/>
          Although I hold a Canadian passport and is legally considered Canadian, my family is actually Chinese. Because of my upbringing, I am fluent in both Chinese and English. I can also understand the dialect of Shanghainese from living in Shanghai.
          I am also "fluent" in two instruments: violin and piano.
         <br/><br/>
          Some things about me: I am a cheerful and optimistic person who is always coming up with <del>weird</del> original ideas. I also love furry animals!! Particulary cats.
          I am also incredibly fond of puns. Even though my friends tell me I am not punny at all, I am trying my best to be even more pawesome every day.
          <br/><br/>
          (Did I succeed in making you cringe? :D)
          <br/><br/>
          Some of the things I enjoy doing include volunteering around the community, playing my violin, playing my piano, reading, writing, and just learning about new things in general! I am also super geeky. I love tech stuff!! I can program in Java, and as you can see here, I know how to make webpages in HTML.
          But hey! I am not just your average geek!!! I also like to go on hiking trips and visit parks! I also <del>play a lot of video games</del> study in my spare time!
          <br/><br/>
          I like to write stories in my spare time, but like all writers, I have times when I run into a writer's block.
          So I decided to make this website for people who are suffering from the writer's block and hopefully you found something inspiring!
          <br/><br/>
          It's a pleasure to meet you!
        </p>
