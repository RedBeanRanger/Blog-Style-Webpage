          <li>
            Pretend there's nobody there and write down anything you like! Don't be afraid! :)
          </li>
          <p class = "meat">When you write, it's best to be as honest as possible.
            That's how you make your plot and your characters believable and appealing to the reader.
            Always have confidence in your writing no matter how ridiculous it seems in the moment.
          <br/><br/>(I'll give you an example first... I just thought of how humans are kind of like a computers... Our eyes are our graphic cards,
          our brains are our processors, our batteries (stomachs) are almost never full...
          I don't know where I was going with that either, but who knows, maybe it will turn into something epic. Just write it down. :D)
          </p>

          <li>
            Write about things that you want to write about.
          </li>
          <p class = "meat"> The story should be worthwhile for the author for it to be worthwhile to the reader.
            Don't waste your time trying to write something that you are bored with!
          </p>

            <li>
              Don't be afraid to scrap ideas either!
            </li>

            <p class = "meat"> Sometimes we have to remember nothing in life is perfect, and it's perfectly fine to just toss some things out the window.
              We change, and our interests and values change with us too, so it's okay to dislike writing about something you once enjoyed writing about.
            </p>

          <li>Always experiment.</li>

          <p class = "meat"> How do you know if you will enjoy writing something or not when you've never even tried it? Try to keep an open mind
            and try writing in a different genre than the one you usually write about.
